Hello, Thanks for choosing Pulse.

Pulse is a tool that school administrators can deploy so students can report incidents. Those reports will print to the Python console.

Please make sure you have Python 3.13.2+ installed.

Special thanks to Allucat1000 for helping me test the code, make the site designs, and having a lot of patience!
